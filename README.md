# lunch-buddy
##1. First thing you need to get the slack bot working is a slack API token unique to your workspace. To obtain this you'll need admin access and will go to <https://api.slack.com/apps/> and click create new app. From here click the second option for create from manifest.

##2. Now that our app is created the next step is to install it to our slack workspace. So when you first open the app you'll see options to install the app and you'll want to select to install it to the SEC workspace.

Another important key (since I spent so much time on the dwight shrute quotes) You'll want to scroll to the bottom of the basic information to *Display Information* and yuo can edit the display information.

This is the user MALs will see in their lunch buddy pairing and you can add an icon (I suggest Dwight Schrute on the desk in season )
Once it's installed you'll want to go to *Install App* on the left side

Then click Copy to copy your API token.
